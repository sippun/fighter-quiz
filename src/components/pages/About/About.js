          The global organization responsible for developing combatants in this world,
          Mr. Big Trainer International, also known as MBTI, has created four scales
          to type fighters as follows:
        </p>

        <h1>Enduring vs. Intensive</h1>
        <p>Enduring: outlast, wear down, tire out opponent</p>
        <p>Intensive: decisive strikes, explosiveness</p>

        <h1>Mental vs. Physical</h1>
        <p>Mental: outwit, out plan, make reads, and mind game</p>
        <p>Physical: faster, stronger, or other physical advantage</p>

        <h1>Tactical vs. Reflexive</h1>
        <p>Tactical: study opponent, plan countermeasures, set traps</p>
        <p>Reflexive: instinctive counters, strategize on the fly</p>

        <h1>Justice vs. Self</h1>
        <p>Justice: Reasons for fighting come from belief in principles or protecting others</p>
        <p>Self: Motivated by personal reasons</p>
    </>
  );
}
